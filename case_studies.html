                        <p>Common notion for the owners in this industry is: Workers will never change, how they work will never change and hence our production will not, Other notion is that there is only one way for this operation to happen and we cannot
                            optimize it. We challenge this notion and with our Machine Learning techniques supported by data science we can optimise the operations cost. Example: Suppose 500 vehicles are owned by transporter. Approx. investment is 100
                            crores. Per day interest is around 600 INR/tanker. If vehicle is standby for one day this cost is added to the operations cost. Mostly its known to transporter but common answer is nothing can be done but with our data inputs
                            we can identify the leakage points and improve productivity. Some examples from data are: loading time is more, unloading time is more, wrong route selected. In all these cases drivers fault is minimum and operational challenges
                            to be identified and corrected. By eliminating above factors we can reduce the cost and if same is partially transferred to customers business can grow multi fold.<br></p>

                        <p>Image analysis can be a game changer for all Sectors where operations are involved. As the prices of cameras are dropping and to increase security of premises cameras are installed at all places. If it is installed in Office, we
                            can count on the time a person sitting on computer or went outside office premises. How much time he spent in canteen etc. It would help to identify the poor performers and help in increased efficiency. Same way with machine
                            footage it can help to calculate running hours of machines and also it can be used to identify first quality of product.<br><br>It can also be applied in any office to count visitors their entry/exit time etc. Same can be interpreted
                            further with our software to optimise manpower deployed in office and average time a customer spends in the office. <br><br>“One thing which makes it so powerful as a tool – if you think about 10 devices each of which have
                            10 settings, that’s 10 billion potential configurations, and not something that the human mind can optimise.<br><br>“But once we are able to train this algorithm to see patterns across the various systems and how they impacted
                            the cooling infrastructure, we were able to see that there is a tremendous opportunity.”<br>&nbsp;<br>With real time data monitoring and processing, we can help to improve business efficiency of man &amp; machine&nbsp;<br></p>
